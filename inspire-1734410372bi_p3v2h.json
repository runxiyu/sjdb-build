Your lips are silent turtle doves (which myeyes can see cooing).\r\nAll your gestures are birds. You are a swallow when you stoop down, acondor when you look at me, an eagle in your ecstasies as a proud, indifferentwoman. You are merely a fluttering of wings, like those of the [...], you are thelake of my seeing.\r\nYou are all winged, winged [...]\r\nIt's raining, raining, raining ...It's raining constantly, plaintively ...My body sets my soul shivering with cold, not the cold that exists in space,but the cold of me being that space\r\nAll pleasure is a vice because seeking pleasure is what everyone does in life, and the worst vice of all is to do what everyone else does.",
