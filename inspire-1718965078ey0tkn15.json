Redeem\r\nThe time. Redeem\r\nThe unread vision in the higher dream\r\nWhile jewelled unicorns draw by the gilded hearse.\r\nThe silent sister veiled in white and blue\r\nBetween the yews, behind the garden god,\r\nWhose flute is breathless, bent her head and signed but spoke no word\r\nBut the fountain sprang up and the bird sang down\r\nRedeem the time, redeem the dream\r\nThe token of the word unheard, unspoken\r\nTill the wind shake a thousand whispers from the yew\r\nAnd after this our exile",
